        <p>The idea of this game is to describe a scent. Weather it be in the air or a physical object. Fiure out what it smells like in terms beyond what it actually is. The "win condition" of this game is dependant on the satisfaction of your own description of the scent.</p>
        <p>This game may be enhancedby playing with others. In this case one would play blindfolded, and unable to touch the thing being smelled. This is to say that others would choose the scent. The "win condition" remains the same. The point is not to know the object, but to intently smell it.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer:DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH TOXIC SUBSTANCES!</p>
